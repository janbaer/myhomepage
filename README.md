This repository contains the source files of my homepage and blog that you can
visit unter [www.janbaer.de](http://www.janbaer.de)

The website is using the powerful blog framework [hexo.io](https://hexo.io)

To deploy a new blog entry you've to execute the following command.

```
hexo deploy -g
```

Since the login with my credentials failed last time, I just went into the hidden directory
**./deploy_git** and entered **git push** manually.
