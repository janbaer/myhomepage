Because of personal reasons I had to reject to both domain names I used for my personal projects
**mdwiki.net** and **howcani.eu**. So from November this years, will no longer be reachable.

But I'll continue with the hosting for both projects as subdomains for the domain I use for my self since many years.
So MDWiki will be reachable under [mdwiki.janbaer.de](mdwiki.janbaer.de) and HowCanI will be hosted
under [howcani.janbaer.de](howcani.janbaer.de).

I'll continue both projects as my personal projects, since I used it for myself for some years. But
it's still possible, to connect to your own GitHub repository.
